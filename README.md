Hoard Allocator
==============

My realization of hoard allocator.
With great help of PolarHare.
As far as I see, it works correctly.
All ideas of this allocator were read from this article: http://people.cs.umass.edu/~emery/pubs/berger-asplos2000.pdf


You may variate consts K and FRACTION - maybe it will work faster.


malloc-testing-master package contains a couple of interesting tests.
